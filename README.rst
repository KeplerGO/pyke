**Developed since 2012, PyKE offers a user-friendly way to inspect and analyze
the pixels and lightcurves obtained by NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.**

What's new in PyKE v3.1? (December 2017)
----------------------------------------

PyKE3 is the latest generation of the Kepler/K2/TESS toolkit.
It provides the following key improvements:

* PyKE3 is now a `pip-installable <http://pyke.keplerscience.org/install.html#installing-pyke>`_ package and supports both Python 2 and 3
* `tasks <http://pyke.keplerscience.org/overview.html>`_ are now available both as command-line tools and Python functions
* documentation and tutorials are now generated using Sphinx
* PyKE3 provides an easy interface to play with target pixel files and light curve files
  from within a Python session
* The PRF photometry tools were refactored into a more flexible interface

See the following IPython notebook for examples of the new features and changes: http://pyke.keplerscience.org/tutorials/ipython_notebooks/whatsnew31.html.

Quickstart
----------

If you have a working version of Python 2 or 3 on your system
(we recommend `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_),
you can simply install the latest stable release of PyKE using ``pip``::

    $ pip install pyketools

With PyKE installed, you can directly visualize frames from a target pixel file.
For example, let's visualize the pixels of Kepler target KIC008462852
(a.k.a. Tabby's Star)::

    $ kepmask kplr008462852-2013098041711_lpd-targ.fits.gz --maskfile mask.txt

.. we should use full url addresses for images henceforth, so that they will be correctly captured by PYPI

``kepmask`` is an interactive tool used to create a custom
aperture mask which can subsequently be used in other PyKE tasks.

For example, we can now use the ``kepextract`` task to perform aperture photometry using the pixels defined using ``kepmask`` above::

    $ kepextract kplr008462852-2013098041711_lpd-targ.fits.gz --outfile lightcurve.fits --maskfile mask.txt

This creates a file called ``lightcurve.fits`` which contains a lightcurve in a format similar to those found in the official archive.
To visualize the resulting light curve, we can use ``kepdraw``::

    $ kepdraw lightcurve.fits
