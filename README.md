<!-- ***Tools for working with data from NASA's Kepler & TESS Space Telescopes.*** -->

Developed since 2012, PyKE offers a user-friendly way to inspect and analyze the pixels and lightcurves obtained by NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.

## What's new in PyKE v3.0? (July 2017)

PyKE3 is the latest generation of the toolkit.
It provides the following key improvements:
* easy installation via `pip`
* support for Python 2 and 3
* support for TESS data
* PyRAF dependency removed

## Installation

If you have a working version of Python 2 or 3 on your system
(we recommend [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)),
you can simply install the latest stable release of PyKE using ``pip``:

    $ pip install pyketools

Alternatively, if you want to experiment with the latest development version of PyKE, you can install it straight from GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE.git
    $ cd PyKE
    $ pip install -e .

Note: PyKE version 2 and older, which was in use between 2012 and 2016 and required PyRAF, is available in the branch ``py27-pyraf``.
