From Target Pixel File to Light Curve
=====================================

In this quick tutorial, we will take a look at a few PyKE tools and primarily
how they can be used for data exploration and analysis.

The specific goal of this tutorial is to show to the user how to create a light curve
based on psf photometry from a target pixel file using PyKE.

First, let's download a target pixel file from [Campaign 9a](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-c9.html):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/c91/200000000/71000/ktwo200071160-c91_lpd-targ.fits.gz

We can visualize one of the frames using ``kepmask``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kepmask ktwo200071160-c91_lpd-targ.fits.gz 0

.. image:: ../_static/images/tutorials/tpf2lc/kepmask.png
    :align: center

We would like to create a light curve for the target located roughly at the (1013, 918) pixel in the detector.

We can use ``keptrim`` to create a target pixel file around the center of our selected target.
For ``keptrim``, we need to provide the center of the target we want and the size of the mask
around the target. So, let's take a 3 x 3 mask around our target:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ keptrim ktwo200071160-c91_lpd-targ.fits.gz ktwo200071160-c91_trimmed_3.fits 1013 918 3

This command creates a target pixel file called ``ktwo200071160-c91_trimmed_3.fits`` in our current directory with only
the desired pixels, while preserving all the original metadata.

The MAST website contains [Pixel Response Function](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/fpc/prf/) (PRF) calibration files for Kepler, which can be used to perform PRF photometry.  We can then use ``kepprfphot`` to fit the Kepler PRF for every frame in our trimmed tpf:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kepprfphot ktwo200071160-c91_lpd-targ-trimmed_3.fits  ktwo200071160-c91_trimmed_3_prfphot --columns 1013 --rows 918 --fluxes 18000 --prfdir ~/kplr2011265_prf --background --clobber --verbose

This command creates a fits file called ``ktwo200071160-c91_trimmed_3_prfphot_0.fits`` with all the results from
the prf photometry including fitted flux and centroids.

We can then write a small python script to see how the light curve looks like

.. code-block:: python

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from astropy.io import fits

    f = fits.open('ktwo200071160-c91_trimmed_3_prfphot_0.fits')
    plt.plot(f[1].data['TIME'], f[1].data['PSF_FLUX'], 'ko', markersize=1)
    plt.xlabel(r'Time')
    plt.ylabel(r'Flux $e^{-} s^{-1}$')
    plt.show()

.. image:: ../_static/images/tutorials/tpf2lc/lc.png
    :align: center

The low frequency components of our light curve can be removed with ``pyke.kepflatten.kepflatten``.
